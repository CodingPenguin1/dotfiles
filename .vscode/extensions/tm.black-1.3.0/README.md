# Black (Dark Theme)

Dark theme for Visual Studio Code that uses the combination of Black and darker variations of red, purple and blue. A perfect theme for those who prefer the darkness.

I recommend that this theme be paired with the [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font as it makes the theme feel much better.
